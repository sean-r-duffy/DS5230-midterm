INFO ON COLUMN TITLES

D2A_EPHHM: The mix of employment types and occupied housing. A block group with a diverse set of    employment types (such as office, retail, and service) plus a large quantity of occupied housing units will have a relatively high value. Higher values correlate with more walk trips.

D2B_E8MIXA: The mix of employment types in a block group (such as retail, office, or industrial). Higher values correlate with more walk trips.

per square mile

having three legs per square mile

D3BMM4: Intersection density in terms of multi-modal intersections
having four or more legs per square mile

intersections having three legs per square mile
